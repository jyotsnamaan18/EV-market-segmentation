# Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation Analysis
Market Segmentation for Electric Vehicle in India


## Introduction:
The purpose of this analysis is to perform market segmentation within the Electric Vehicle (EV) market to identify potential target segments and customize marketing strategies accordingly. This README file provides an overview of the analysis process and key findings.

## Data Pre-processing:
### Data Source:
- Dataset: [4-wheeler-EV-carwale.csv]
- Source: CarWale website or any other relevant source

### Libraries Used:
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

### Steps:
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Drop irrelevant columns ('review', 'Condition', 'driven', 'model_name').
3. Check for missing values and handle them by dropping rows with missing values.
4. Perform feature scaling using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the range of features.

## Segment Extraction:
### Clustering Algorithm Used:
- KMeans

### Hyperparameters Tuned:
- Number of clusters (K)

### Steps:
1. Perform KMeans clustering on the scaled data.
2. Tune the number of clusters (K) using the elbow method.
3. Extract cluster labels and add them to the DataFrame.
4. Visualize the clusters using scatter plots, pair plots, and box plots.

## Profiling and Describing Segments:
- Describe the characteristics of each segment based on cluster means.
- Provide insights into the distinguishing features of each segment.
- Use visualizations such as box plots or histograms to illustrate differences between segments.

## Selecting Target Segment:
- Evaluate each segment based on criteria such as size, growth potential, profitability, and alignment with business goals.
- Select the segment that offers the highest potential for growth and profitability.
- Justify the selection based on data analysis and market insights.

## Customizing Marketing Mix:
- Provide insights on the type of EV to produce based on segment characteristics.
- Estimate the approximate cost of producing the EV based on features and specifications.
- Identify the potential customer base for the EV based on segment profiles.
- Discuss strategies for marketing, pricing, distribution, and promotion tailored to the selected target segment.

## Conclusion:
Market segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into the EV market, enabling companies to identify target segments and tailor marketing strategies to meet the needs and preferences of different customer groups. By focusing on the selected target segment and customizing the marketing mix accordingly, companies can position their EV products for success in the competitive automotive market.
